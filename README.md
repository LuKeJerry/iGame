## Builds and releases

The iGame_rel folder should contain builds that are done at some point in time, following any major code changes.

## Installing

Just place the iGame folder anywhere you want on your drive. iGame also requires the following libraries to work:

* guigfx.mcc

Make sure your installation contains MUI and the above libraries. You can find the latest versions in Aminet.
